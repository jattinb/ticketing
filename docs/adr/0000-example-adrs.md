# Use Knex for Database Migrations

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a reliable and flexible tool for managing database schema changes. The chosen tool should support both SQL and NoSQL databases, provide a straightforward API, and integrate well with our current tech stack (Node.js).

## Decision

We decided to use Knex.js as our query builder and migration tool. Knex.js supports various database types and has a simple yet powerful migration API.

## Consequences

- Positive: Knex.js provides a robust solution for managing database migrations, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- Positive: The team is already familiar with Knex.js, reducing the learning curve.
- Negative: Limited to the features provided by Knex.js; may need additional tools for advanced database management.

# Use Apollo Server for GraphQL

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a server that supports GraphQL to improve the efficiency of our API. The server should be compatible with our existing Express.js setup and provide robust tooling for schema definition and resolver management.

## Decision

We decided to use Apollo Server to implement our GraphQL API. Apollo Server integrates seamlessly with Express.js and offers extensive tooling for schema management, resolver functions, and performance monitoring.

## Consequences

- Positive: Simplifies the implementation of GraphQL APIs with a rich ecosystem of tools.
- Positive: Provides built-in support for performance monitoring and debugging.
- Negative: Adds an additional layer of complexity to the project setup.

# Handle N+1 Problem in GraphQL

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The N+1 problem is a common issue in GraphQL when multiple related queries are executed inefficiently. We need a solution to batch these queries to improve performance.

## Decision

We decided to use DataLoader to batch and cache database requests. DataLoader helps optimize the performance of our GraphQL API by reducing the number of database queries.

## Consequences

- Positive: Significant performance improvements by reducing the number of database queries.
- Positive: Simplifies handling of batched requests and caching logic.
- Negative: Adds an additional dependency to the project.
